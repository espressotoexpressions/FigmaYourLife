// Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment: Kassandra Spacek: Looks great! I like how you designed it. The right alignment is neet. The little socials icons at the bottom are a nice touch to, though I'm gussing based on the fact that they are all linkedback to the index page, that it is on purpose they are linked that way. They don't really link to any socials.
